# Overview
IMeal is a command line interface meal genearter. 

The program will ask some questions to users, and use the answers to generate some meals that meet the user requirments. 
SYSTEM REQUIREMENTï¼š at least 4GB of memory

# Setup Constraint
After start the program, the user should answer the questions that pop up in the shell

There are 7 questions:
* Enter number of days you want to generated:
 * Users have to provide an integer
* Enter how much energy/calories do you want to have per day: 
 * Users can answer it with an integer or leave it empty, empty response will be treated as no requirements.
* Enter how much protein do you want to have per day: 
 * Users can answer it with an integer or leave it empty, empty response will be treated as no requirements.
* Enter how much sugar do you want to have per day:
 * Users can answer it with an integer or leave it empty, empty response will be treated as no requirements.
* Enter how much calcium do you want to have per day: 
 * Users can answer it with an integer or leave it empty, empty response will be treated as no requirements.
* Enter a budget limitation per day: 
 * User can answer it with an integer or leave it empty, empty response will be treated as no requirements.
* Special requests
 * There are two special requests that the user can choose. 
  * reduce repeated meals
    * If the user chooses this request, the program will try to avoid providing repeated meals to the user.
  * eat as much as you can
    * With this request, the program will try to provides the meals that meet the requirements as mush as it can. Without this request, the program will generate meals arbitrary. 
    
The program will generate constraints based on the user requirments. 

# Some new implementation
We implemented a new CSP model called MealCSP, it inherits the CSP class from assignment 2. We implemented some new helper functions in this class to improve the performance on our program.

We implemented a food class which represents a food. 

We implementated a new BT class for us to get the status of a search easily.

We also implemented a new value ordering function. This function basically handles the two special requests.


# Usage
Run main.pyf
## Example Usage and Output
```
Thanks for using IMeal
Enter number of days you want to generated: 10
Enter how much energy/calories do you want to have per day: 3000
Enter how much protein do you want to have per day: 300
Enter how much sugar do you want to have per day: 300
Enter how much calcium do you want to have per day: 2000
Enter a budget limitation per day: 1000
You can select some special request: 
Do you want to reduce repeated meals
yes
Do you want to eat as much as you can
yes
Start generating meals
